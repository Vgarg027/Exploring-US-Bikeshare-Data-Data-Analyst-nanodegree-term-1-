THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

The script has been made user friendly and fast. Also reasonable use of pandas has been done.
Before running, DO CHANGE THE PATH of the csv file in "statistics column" in the code, according to need.


PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. A code to import the data and answer interesting questions has been made by computing descriptive statistics. The script has been written that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


SOFTWARES USED:

To complete this project, the following software were used:
-Python 3, NumPy, and Pandas installed using Anaconda
-A text editor i.e Atom.
-Anaconda prompt to run scripts


STATISTICS COMPUTED:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
-most common month
-most common day of week
-most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip:
-most common start station
-most common end station
-most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration:
-total travel time
-average travel time

#4 User info:
-counts of each user type
-counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)

#5 Birth year info:
Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS:

-The city file name can be in any case but it will still be recognised.
-To increase the interactivity different prompts have been used.
-At every stage of data input 'choice to exit' the program has been given.
-The computation time has been considered and during that time appropriate message is displayed.
-The code is error free and error handling is properly done.
-User can try wrong inputs and they will be properly handled.
-Choice to display raw data is given.
